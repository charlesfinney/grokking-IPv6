# grokking-IPv6
  
    
## Course Purpose: 
To learn and grok IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6).
  

<h2>What is IPv6</h2>

* A new IP addressing structure to acomodate the "Internet of Things" (IOT). 
* 128-bit address represented as 32 hex digits (IPv4 was 32-bits)
* Addresses are compdsed of eight groups of four hex digits.
example `2000:0bd2:76c4:0000:a4b7:0000:d56h:3467`
* IPv6 provides 2<sup>128</sup> addresses = 340 Undecillion that's 36 Zeros or 12 groups of three Zeros
* 667 sextillion addresses per Square meter of the Earth.
* IPv6 is a "seperate internet" from the IPv4 internet protocol
there are gateways between IPv6 and IPv4 to provide tunnels, and from now on there will be IPv6 only websites 
* Blockchain technology and new forms of IOT crypto currencies will be the only way to provide effective internet security by applying market forces to hack attacks.
